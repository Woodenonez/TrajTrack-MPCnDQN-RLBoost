# DQN-Boosted MPC for Collision-Free Navigation of Mobile Robots
*Collision-Free Trajectory Planning of Mobile Robots by Integrating
Deep Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control*

**Please find our newest work (published at IROS 2024): [DDPG-boosted MPC for Multiple Mobile Robots](https://github.com/kristianceder/DRL-Traj-Planner)** I mainly worked on the multi-robot part which is under the corresponding branch.

## Quick Start
### OpEn
The NMPC formulation is solved using open source implementation of PANOC, namely [OpEn](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/). Follow the [installation instructions](https://alphaville.github.io/optimization-engine/docs/installation) before proceeding. 

### Install dependencies (after installing OpEn)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
**NOTE** If you cannot create the virtual environment via conda, please create your own virtual environment (e.g. conda create -n rlboost python=3.9), and pip install.
Make sure your RUST is up-to-date and Pytorch is compatible with Cuda. 

### Generate MPC solver
Go to "test_block_mpc.py", change **INIT_BUILD** to true and run
```
python test_block_mpc.py
```
After this, a new directory *mpc_build* will appear and contain the solver. Then, you are good to go :)

### To train the DQN
Go to "test_block_rl.py", change **TO_TRAIN** and **TO_SAVE** to true and run.

## Use Case
Run *main.py* for the simulation in Python. Several cases are available by changing ```scene_option``` in *main.py*.
